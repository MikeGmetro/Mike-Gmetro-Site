    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="background: #e0f7fa; padding: 1rem; border-left: 5px solid #2a9d8f; border-radius: 5px; font-weight: bold;">Helping couples reconnect is more than my profession—it’s my passion. I am deeply committed to walking alongside couples who feel stuck, distant, or discouraged and empowering them with hope, tools, and guidance to become closer than ever before. I believe every relationship can be transformed and thrive for a lifetime with intentional support.</p>
    <p>I'm Mike Gmetro, a certified relationship and life coach with over 20 years of experience helping couples grow in emotional intimacy, resolve conflict, and rekindle connection. Whether you're dating, engaged, or married for decades, I offer practical tools to strengthen your relationship from the inside out.</p>
    <p>I bring a unique blend of experiences to my coaching: a former college baseball player and coach, a pastor and teacher for over 20 years, and a national keynote speaker who has inspired thousands. My greatest joy is being a devoted husband and proud father. These roles have shaped my perspective and fuel my desire to serve couples with authenticity, strength, and compassion.</p>

  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>From the baseball diamond to the pulpit, and now to the coaching chair, my journey has been all about guiding, leading, and encouraging people to reach their full potential. As a former college baseball player and coach, I developed discipline, teamwork, and perseverance—qualities that now shape my coaching style.</p>
  <p>For over 20 years, I served as a pastor, walking with individuals and families through seasons of growth, grief, and transformation. My passion for helping people grow spiritually and relationally has led me to speak nationally, inspire diverse audiences, and provide biblically rooted insights that touch hearts and change lives.</p>
  <p>But my most important roles are being a loving husband and dedicated father. My family is my anchor, my joy, and my reminder that relationships are the heart of life. It’s from this foundation that I coach—with authenticity, wisdom, and a deep desire to see couples thrive for a lifetime.</p>

    <h2>Faith & Values</h2>
    <p>As a Christian relationship coach, my work is rooted in biblical truth and a heart to serve couples through Christ-centered guidance. I believe lasting love is built on grace, forgiveness, humility, and the example of Jesus.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grace-Filled Coaching:</strong> Drawing from Ephesians 4:2 — "Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love."</li>
      <li><strong>Forgiveness as a Foundation:</strong> Inspired by Colossians 3:13 — "Forgive as the Lord forgave you."</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose-Driven Relationships:</strong> Based on Proverbs 24:3 — "By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding it is established."</li>
      <li><strong>Shared Spiritual Growth:</strong> Encouraging couples to pray together, study the Word, and serve one another.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every session is approached with prayerful intent, compassion, and practical tools that align with biblical principles. Whether you are walking through a storm or simply want to strengthen your spiritual connection as a couple, I am here to help.</p>
