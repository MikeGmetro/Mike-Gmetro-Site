      <h1>About Mike Gmetro</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Mike Gmetro, and I’m genuinely glad you’re here. If you’re visiting this site, chances are you’re looking for real, lasting change in your relationship—and I want you to know you’ve come to the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        With nearly 25 years of marriage, a master’s degree, and a rich background in nonprofit leadership and business management, I’ve spent my life walking alongside people to help them grow stronger, communicate better, and reconnect deeply. My approach to coaching is both encouraging and highly practical. Whether you’re dealing with communication struggles, unresolved conflict, intimacy challenges, or simply a sense of drifting apart—I’m here to help you rebuild, renew, and thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a former college baseball player and coach, I understand teamwork at its core. I bring the same energy and strategy to coaching couples—helping you become teammates again, working together toward something beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our sessions, you’ll get more than just advice. You’ll leave each week with simple, fun, and effective takeaways—“relationship workouts” that build habits of listening, speaking, and loving well. My goal is for you to feel seen, heard, and supported as you move toward a life-giving relationship that lasts.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Let’s do this together. Let’s help your love thrive.</strong></p>
